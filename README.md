# Sierpinski-Triangle
Fun short script to create and test Sierpinki's three-way recursive algorithm fractal.

To run the script:
1. Have or install Python 3 + Jupyter Notebook (I suggest downloading Anaconda both in one install)
2. In Jupyter Notebook run the Fractal.ipynb file
3. See the fractal take form!
You can tweak the values to create different formed fractals.
